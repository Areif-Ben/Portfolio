The Framingham Heart Study was a turning point in identifying the risk factors of heart disease, and is one of the most important epidemiological studies conducted.
I attempted to build a decision tree classifier in Python that can predict the ten year risk of a patient developing CHD, given certain risk factors. <br> <br>

# [Project 2: Predicting Telco Customer Churn](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16VFz131h1Fs2BtAbfn6-Om1nFbkMEjhL?usp=sharing#scrollTo=gFnMrOKfE1FB)

With independent variables such as gender, tenure, and opt-in business services such as phone lines and internet services, the goal is to accurately identify customers who may churn. Customer retention and revenue generated from retention, re-subscription, and even cross-selling revenues contribute to the total customer lifetime value, which can be measured (LTV). The system's success could be measured by examining the model's accuracy in predicting whether or not a customer will churn. The model's ultimate goal is to help telcos drive revenue and profit. <br> <br>
