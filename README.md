# [Project 1: Framingham Case Study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vld9f8b6oj8PJ8KpK6MftD2noC2AG9q9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=H7AENigly2Ir)

The Framingham Heart Study was a turning point in identifying the risk factors of heart disease, and is one of the most important epidemiological studies conducted.
I attempted to build a decision tree classifier in Python that can predict the ten year risk of a patient developing CHD, given certain risk factors. <br> <br>

# [Project 2: Predicting Telco Customer Churn](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16VFz131h1Fs2BtAbfn6-Om1nFbkMEjhL?usp=sharing#scrollTo=gFnMrOKfE1FB)

<br>

With independent variables such as gender, tenure, and opt-in business services such as phone lines and internet services, the goal is to accurately identify customers who may churn. Customer retention and revenue generated from retention, re-subscription, and even cross-selling revenues contribute to the total customer lifetime value, which can be measured (LTV). The system's success could be measured by examining the model's accuracy in predicting whether or not a customer will churn. The model's ultimate goal is to help telcos drive revenue and profit. <br> <br>

Strategy and marketing are like bread and butter, and choosing the right channels and creating a strategy can be daunting. By evaluating the effectiveness of ads on social media, networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Google to make sure the business knows which business decision to make. Here I will attempt to estimate sales when advertising on different social media platforms; suggest strategic budgeting and advertising plans.

# [Project 4: Sentiment Analysis on Steam reviews](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CzjJtt_FHxkkiMXfFMuIRaVjJ-5QXqXN?usp=sharing)

Steam is a digital distribution platform designed specifically for gamers and game developers. While it was initially limited to PC games, the platform quickly expanded to include home video game consoles such as the Xbox and Sony PlayStation. Companies can use text analysis to learn how their customers feel about their brands and products, as well as whether specific reviews are positive or negative, and which topics customers mention and why. Keeping an eye on feedback and sentiments allows businesses to identify pain points, areas for improvement, and new opportunities.

The number of people who quit is critical to a company's success. Employees are an important part of any business, so having a high turnover rate could be dangerous. Understanding what motivates people can help organisations save money by retaining key employees.
